  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/construction_truck.svg
    - assets/google_logo.png
    - assets/apple_logo.png
    - assets/images/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see

  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
